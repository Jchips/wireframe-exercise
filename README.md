### Reflections and Comments

* Assignment went fine.
* I wasn't sure how to make the elements/images on the page responsive. Everything looked fine when the page is at it's normal full-screen computer width, but if you change the width of the page to be smaller everything kind of breaks, so I'm not sure how to have the page responsive so that it looks the same on all devices at the same time as have the fixed widths on the page.
* Took me a few hours. I expected it to take me quicker.
